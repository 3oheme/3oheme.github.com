Today I had a bad day. It's not your fault, and neither mine. But I will use this blog post to release some steam. 

(listen with infommercial voice)

Hey, you! Are you looking for ways to gain visibility in the industry? Do you want your one hit wonder? Attract users to your blog? Tweet some vanity metrics?

Here's the definite guide to to boost your UX career!

### Make {something} with CSS

Haters gonna hate when they see your amazing CSS skills stealing the show. Go big and take this suggestions:

* Something Star Wars related: Darth Vader in CSS, R2D2 with CSS transformations, Yoda with just box-shadows and fourteen empty divs
* Something completely unrelated: A menstrual calendar in CSS, Minesweeper in CSS, A Dijkstra algorithm with pseudo selectors
* 

Remember to add 'Look ma, no Javascript' and mention the great performance of CSS only solutions (say GPU and profiling)

### Write a blog post about "should designers code?"

You are coming late to the party, but hey, we're still looking for the correct answer that can be apply to every single designer. We can fund and invest in the first Designgrammers University

### What {something} taught me about User Experience

And here's the hook: that 'something' needs to be as unrelated as possible with User Experience, like:

* What the boisson Higgs taught me about User Experience
* What midget porn taught me about conducting user testing sessions
* What Buddha taught me about multivariate analysis
*

### Facebook/twitter/whatever redesign

Yes! Go wild with this one: assume everyone is wrong, and show them how to improve the user experience with 

* Change aversion? F*ck off, these peasants are going to love your designs!
* Hypothesis? Assumptions? Testing my design? never!
