Styleguides are a great way to document your CSS. And you really need them.

Why? Well, the same reason we need things like SASS or LESS. The W3 Consortium defined CSS as Cascading Style Shits, but they had to change it for somewhat legal reasons.

My own experience has shown me the following:

* Backend devs are not really [interested in CSS](http://imgur.com/Q3cUg29)
* But, given the right tools, devs are able to create proper HTML+CSS

And what are these tools? a [framework with documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/).
