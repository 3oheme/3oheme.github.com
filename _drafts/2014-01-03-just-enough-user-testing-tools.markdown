Inspired by the great [just enough research](http://www.abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research) book from [Erika Hall](https://twitter.com/mulegirl), I decided that we should have exactly the same for user testing tools — Lean UX requires quick validation of ideas and prototypes, and the faster we find issues, the faster we can iterate towards a better solution.

PS: I'm just focusing on free tools, as they lower even more the barrier to start testing as soon as possible.

Microtasks oriented, [PlunkApp](http://www.plunkapp.com/) is a very easy way to test clicks on a mobile phone — the workflow is dead easy:

* First decide the task you'll ask your users (for example "Where would you click to change your avatar image?")
* Upload an image to the app
* Select the success area
* We're done!

[PopApp](https://popapp.in/) was one of the first tools to give anyone the possibility to quickly create prototypes. Draw a couple of screens on paper, take some pictures with your phone camera, add a bit of interaction and share your creation :-)

I've even reccommend this app to people with no technological background, as a way to introduce them to the prototyping world. The fact that the whole tool is self-contained (you can achieve the whole thing just with your phone) and they can 'create working apps' will help them start hands-on and realise how the process is.

[marvelApp](http://www.marvelapp.com/) is a web-based app to create prototypes using dropbox as your file picker. Simple, easy and free.

[InvisionApp](http://www.invisionapp.com/) Very easy prototyping tool from images, with support for desktop, mobile and tablet prototypes, highly recommended!
