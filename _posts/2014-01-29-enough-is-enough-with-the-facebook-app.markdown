Can you spot the missing app in my home screen?

Enough is enough. Today I removed the Facebook app from my Nexus 4, because this is not fair. This application should not need to ask for so many different and broad permissions to run.

I'm not saying I'm leaving Facebook — I will keep on having a look from time to time, but using their webapp or from the desktop.

In case you are interested, here is the full list of actions that the Facebook app can do in your Android device (list updated 29 January 2014 from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana)) — I've bolded the most relevant pieces for me.
