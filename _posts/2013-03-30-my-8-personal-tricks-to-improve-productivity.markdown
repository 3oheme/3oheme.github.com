I consider myself a creative person (yeehaa!). That means thinking in lots of different stuff during the day and also getting easily distracted :-(

That’s why I have my small list of tricks and techniques to be extremely focused in specific tasks. Basically they try to accomplish two different things:

1. Get motivated
2. Be focused

That can be grouped into a single objective: **Hack yourself!**
 

So if you are trying to be motivated:

* First of all, **think about what are you going to do and why** – that is the only way to really get motivated, having a reason to do the task.
* Start with a **to-do list**: I love crossing out every task I do, so I feel I’m progressing.
* Look for your ‘[carrot and stick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick)’: is a good idea having some kind of reward if you finish all your stuff (but remember to be fair!)

And trying to be focused is when stuff starts getting interesting:

* **Music**: you are more than welcome to listen music; is a great way to run away from the world and get into our distraction-free environment. But my only advice is that **you should listen to music you have listened a lot before**. That way you will settle yourself in a well-known place, and music will sit in the background, instead of being in front of you.
* **Turn off your phone** — this is a no-brainer! or at least disable notifications.
* Music is not your cup of tea? **Try different kinds of noise** — for example [white noise](http://simplynoise.com/) is great to get concentrated.
* Noise is so hardcore? lets have some nature sounds to get the hell out of here! [naturesoundsforme](http://naturesoundsfor.me/) is a free webtool to get some cool thunderstorms, rain and other nature stuff.
* Feeling lonely? get yourself into a **comfy coffee** with [coffitivity.com](coffitivity.com) and enjoy some real people background noise :-D

That’s some of the tools I have in my bat-tool belt to do to get some shit done. Cheers!
