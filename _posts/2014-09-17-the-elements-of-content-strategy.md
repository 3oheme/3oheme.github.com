*— Yo dawg!*

Hey, how's going buddy?

<br>

*— What is this?*

[The Elements of Content Strategy](http://www.abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy) is the third book from A Book Apart, written by [Erin Kissane](https://twitter.com/kissane) and to briefly summarize it's a handbook about everything that needs to be done to put some copy out there — from managing resources and stakeholders to set legacy content audits or define long term strategies.

Want the [buzzword version](http://uxbullshit.com/)? This cookbook will empower your systems to cross-polinate insightful content synergies and engage users via high-volume digital seamless channels.

*— Who is this Erin?*

Maybe her name doesn't ring a bell to you, but she's been a editor in [A list apart](http://alistapart.com/) for nearly ten years, and the editorial director of [The Happy Cog Studios](http://cognition.happycog.com/). Pretty damn good, right?

<br>

*— And what do you think of the book?*

I'm glad you ask dude! It's a lovely little jewel (around 70 pages of real content) that does what it promises: the book explains from top to bottom everything you need to think about when developing a full content strategy, both as a consultant or as a internal worker.

It's important to notice that this book doesn't cover any specifics about copy writing, story telling, information architecture or even defining business goals. 

<br>

*— So... Shoud I read it?*

It depends :-) this book explains a general approach for content strategies, so would only recommend it to experienced or senior consultants, because:

* It's oriented to an influencer role — a content strategist is more a facilitator and leader, as it needs to manage different teams, roles and stakeholders.
* It requires some previous knowledge in different fields, like user experience or stakeholder management.

Did I like it? Yes!
