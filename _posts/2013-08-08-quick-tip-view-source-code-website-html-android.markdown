If you're a nerd like me you've probably find yourself trying to view the source code of a website from your Android device using chrome app. So here is a small nice trick from Google guys:

**Just append 'view-source:' to any url to see the source code of the website**

Example â€” Load any website in Chrome:

<p><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/view_source_android_chrome_step_1.png" /></p>

Move the cursor to the beginning of the url:

<p><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/view_source_android_chrome_step_2.png" /></p>

Append **view-source:** (don't forget the semicolon at the end)

<p><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/view_source_android_chrome_step_3.png" /></p>

And here we are! happy nerd! :-)

<p><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/view_source_android_chrome_step_4.png" /></p>
