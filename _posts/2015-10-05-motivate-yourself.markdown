Motivation. I suck at it, badly. 

You've probably never heard of [Dražen Petrović](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dra%C5%BEen_Petrovi%C4%87). He was one of the first europeans to play in the NBA and [probably the best shooter ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EUo5p6D990), but in words of Janez Drvaric, his previous coach, he was not talented. At all.

So how did he manage to become one of the most successful shooters in NBA history? He shoot. Every single day. A lot. Janez Drvaric says:

> Before training with the whole team, he usually spent an hour and a half with individual training, and after the official training session, he stayed in the court, shooting. At least 500 shoots per day.

Every single day, he found the courage and motivation to push himself a bit more, to shoot one more time, pushing the limits.

Why am I telling you this? Well, recently I decided to improve my Javascript skills. You know, using it the proper way. I have lots of experience with HTML, CSS and jQuery, but I've never had the opportunity to deal with any major Javascript framework, so I thought I'd better start learning some proper Javascript. I got a copy of [Javascript, the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742), one of the best books about the subject, and started reading it.

I was doing pretty well for a couple of days, until I just found myself not reading it anymore. It turns out I'm not Dražen Petrović.

So I decided to try something new to motivate myself, a technique called **Temptation bundling**.

As defined by [Katherine Milkman](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/researchers-used-hunger-games-encourage-healthier-choices/), temptation bundling:

> “involves coupling instantly gratifying ‘want’ activities with engagement in a ‘should behavior’ that provides long-term benefits but requires the exertion of willpower”

In a nutshell, temptation bundling happens when you pair an instantly gratifying guilty pleasure with an activity you know you should do more often. So, in my case, I knew I had to bundle Javascript with a guilty pleasure. Eating chocolate? watching Breaking Bad again? Mmm what about developing videogames?

Javascript and videogames. Sounds good, right?

So I've been developing [Reactclicker](https://github.com/3oheme/reactclicker) for a couple of weeks — yes, one of the silliest videogame ever is my purposeful guilty pleasure to learn Javascript, ReactJS, Flux and NPM. Just a [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/beta/) clone, simple enough to be easy to start with, but with room to add complexity, new layers, levels and features to face interesting and challenging problems.

<span class="smaller-text">The app embraces minimalism while providing subtle affordances to lower the user cognitive load.</span></p>

And today **I'm 29 commits closer to achieve my goal**, I've learnt how to build an npm workflow, about tap and hold interaction patterns in mobile, how to create a useful .gitignore, creating todo lists in markdown, HTML5localstorage and so on, while having fun.

This may not work for you, and you probably should find a bundle that suits your needs, but you should definitely give it a try. Because not everyone is like Dražen Petrović.
