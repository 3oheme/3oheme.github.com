Let's face it. You've been developing your awesome app for months, filled dribble with hundreds of photoshop comps and here comes the moment to decide if we should use a hamburger icon for your navigation interaction.

So here I am, helping you with the final and definitive howto guide about whether you should use the hamburger icon or not.

##It depends. Do some user testing. Every scenario is different.
