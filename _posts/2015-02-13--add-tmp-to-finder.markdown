**Just a little trick for OSX users**: If you need a temporary folder (for example, to place a file you need to attach to an email later), instead of filling your Desktop or any other folder, you can use the [default /tmp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder), that gets deleted on every reboot.

To get it, simply:

* Open a Finder window
* Click Go → Go to folder... and type /private/tmp
* Once in the folder, Click File → Add to Sidebar

I find it really handy when I need to send mockups from Illustrator :-)
