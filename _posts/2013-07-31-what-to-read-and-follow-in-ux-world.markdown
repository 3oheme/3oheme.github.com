Today in the office I've been asked about how to be up-to-date in the user experience world, and I thought it'd be quite useful to post it here, so anyone can benefit from it :-)

So here we are, the 12 most awesome blogs you should read, in no specific order:

* The famous and well-known [Alert box by Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles).
* An amazing live document about [User-centered design](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centered-design) from United Kingdom Government Service Design Manual.
* [Quince](http://quince.infragistics.com/) — an UX patterns explorer.
* [UXMyths](http://uxmyths.com/), as they say, you should build your website based on evidence, not false beliefs.
* A nice and general overview about that UX design thing thanks to [UX apprentice](http://www.uxapprentice.com/)
* The classic must: [A list apart](http://alistapart.com/) about webdev best practices, mostly frontend and UX.
* [mediaqueri.es](http://mediaqueri.es/) — a curated selection of the best responsive websites
* If you want to learn the whole web stack from the very beginning, you should try [HackDesign](http://hackdesign.org/), a sort-of online course based in blog posts, very easy to follow.
* [Lukew articles](http://www.lukew.com/ff/) are interesting, nicely written and based on real data.
* [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Design news](https://news.layervault.com/), for up-to-date stuff.
