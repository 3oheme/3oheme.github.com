After this [hilarious retweet from Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1193719439772078080), I thought I'd be great to share my collection of super fail design decisions of priorising design consistency versus a proper user centric design, because Design systems are killing creativity and whatnot :-D

So, in case you need more reasons to break some design conventions for the user, here you have some more examples:

<div class="full-width-100-percent"><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/consistency-1.jpg" /></div>

<style>
.full-width-100-percent {
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
  background: red;
}
</style>
