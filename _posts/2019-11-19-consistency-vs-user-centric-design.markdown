After this [hilarious retweet from Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1193719439772078080), I thought I'd be great to share my collection of super fail design decisions of priorising design consistency versus a proper user centric design, because Design systems are killing creativity and whatnot :-D

So, in case you need more reasons to break some design conventions for the user, here you have some more examples:

<div class="consistency-gallery">
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-1.jpg" />
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-2.jpg" />
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-3.jpg" />
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-4.jpg" />
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-5.jpg" />
  <img class="consistency-gallery--item" src="/images/consistency-6.jpg" />
</div>

<style>
  .consistency-gallery {} 
  .consistency-gallery--item {}
</style>
