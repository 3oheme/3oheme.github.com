Quick!

This is my very brief review of the [Camp Digital: Bite size](http://www.wearesigma.com/latest/posts/2013/august/9/camp-digital-bite-sized-%E2%80%93-join-us-at-mmu-new-business-school-on-18th-september.aspx) hosted by [Sigma](http://www.wearesigma.com/) — this review is only focused in stuff I found interesting, so here we go!

### First talk

First one was Chris Bush [@suthen](https://twitter.com/suthen) about **Guerrilla testing** (BTW, am I the only one that hear gorilla instead of guerrilla?).

Classic intro about UX, differences between lab testing and guerrilla, advantages and disadvantages as usual.

New stuff for me:

* Use a scribe to help you manage the testing, and
* if you are testing responsive design in mobile, there is a very nice app called [UX recorder](http://www.uxrecorder.com/) that is like [silverback](http://silverbackapp.com/) but for mobile and tablets :-D

### Second talk

Very interesting and entertaining, presented by [Simon Wharton](http://www.pushon.co.uk/author/simonwharton/) from [PushOn](http://www.pushon.co.uk/), about how we can improve the overall user experience of the site with Google Analytics.

The cool things:

* UX design tries to solve problems in a **top down approach**, while analytics can solve them in a **bottom up**.
* Ask Google Analytics how can you [improve the site speed of your site](http://p.barker.dj/sitespeedtips) using the **content -> site speed tab**, as that can be a major improvement to the final user.
* Did you know that you can very easily **copy and paste different dashboards to your google analytics account**? He recommended adding the [facts about visitors dashboard](dashboardjunkie.com/visitor-facts-dashboard) from [dashboardjunkie](http://www.dashboardjunkie.com/) website. 
* Last, but not least, you can use Google Analytics to do all the dirty job when using A/B testing — comparing, deciding which one is stadistically better and even adding JS to serve different pages to the end user!


### Third talk

Last one was Ian Richards, from Serco Global, talking about creativity in a business scenario, and how BAs and UXs should apply creativity in different ways.

This talk was more inspirational than practical, but included some very nice quotes like:

*We need to find the balance between creativity, uniformity and standarisation.*
