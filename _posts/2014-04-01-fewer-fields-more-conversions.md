Be humble.

That's a great rule we should try to apply in every scenario. With your friends, family, with your partner. And, of course, your everyday job and your user experience designs.

That's exactly what I thought when I read the great [No one wants to use your website](http://bit.ly/1fGCaPd) by [@seanthielen](https://twitter.com/seanthielen).

Don't ask for too much to your users. I'm so sorry to tell you, but they are not willing to give you their details, or their phone number. Remember the last time you were asked for your email? It was hard to hand it over, isn't?
