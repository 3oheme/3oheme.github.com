Hi there!

We all know that user personas are a fantastic technique to develop a good user-centered design but, when you've just finished your first one, the magic question then arises: **where can I get some good portrait photos for my personas?**

So, Here you have some excellent resources to help you find good pictures:

* First of all, the easy one: [Flickr searching for portrait pictures](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=portrait&l=commderiv&ct=0&mt=all&adv=1) under creative common license.
* The new tool in town: [randomuser.me](http://randomuser.me/) — They even provide an API to fetch JSON files with random user names :-D
* The classic: [sxc.hu](http://www.sxc.hu/) — it requires to create a free account, but is a good resource for royalty-free stock images.
* new! [Free Avatar Pack from PlaceIt](http://blog.placeit.net/free-avatar-pack/) 200 avatars, 300x300px, completely free (thanks [Antonio Freire](https://api.designernews.co/users/15442/antonio-freyre))
* And the sweetest and coolest source: [exactitudes.com](http://www.exactitudes.com) — an amazing photography series from Photographer [Ari Versluis](http://www.ariversluis.com) and profiler [Ellie Uyttenbroek](http://v2.nl/archive/people/ellie-uyttenbroek), focusing in different dress codes and social groups. Just have a look, even if you're not looking for persona pictures.

Remember to check that the license matches your project, and enjoy!
