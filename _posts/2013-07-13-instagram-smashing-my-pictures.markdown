</a></p>

Mouse hover for before and after. Or just click for full screen. Or simply [see the photo as it appears in Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/boHqmuEMSn/).

Taken with a Nexus4, cropped and processed in Instagram and no other editing programs involved.

Am I the only one that is experiencing this kinds of problems? I know that Instagram is not Flickr or 500px, but this is way too far :-(

**UPDATE**: It looks like that the latest instagram update messed up with a *new quality image processing* on Android. To fix this:

* Open **instagram**
* Go to your **profile**
* Open **settings**
* Select **Advanced features**
* And disable **Use High-Quality Image Processing**

Thanks to [@josejacas](https://twitter.com/josejacas/status/330369002020954112) for the fix.
