A couple of days ago I received my bi-weekly [GoodUI](http://www.goodui.org/) newsletter.

Writing emails is not an easy task, writing good emails is quite complex, and writing a newsletter is even harder — that's why I'm quite surprised to realise I haven't unsubscribed from it yet! :-)

And why are so good? Because [Jakub](https://twitter.com/jlinowski) applies lots of small and nice tricks — I tried to tear them down and I got some great ideas I'd love to share.

But first let's show the email:

Why is this email working? Because...

### The email feels personal

Starting from the mail sender, the whole mail is handcrafted thinking in the user (the famous [user-centered design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) everyone talks about)

He starts with a 'Hi Ignacio' — hey look, that's my name! — this is a very powerful trick.

**Dale Carnegie**, author of the best seller [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), wrote:

> If you want to win friends, make it a point to remember them. If you remember my name, you pay me a subtle compliment; you indicate that I have made an impression on you. Remember my name and you add to my feeling of importance.

**Second thing**: He sends the email from his personal email account. Is not a company, or a association. Is a real person, and Gmail even shows his face :-)

Want to make it even more human? Jakub even finishes sharing some information about his personal life:

— Hope this helps and sorry about skipping the email from two weeks ago - was on a nice little vacation in a warmer country (than snowy Canada). :)

### Just suggest some ideas

Nowadays there are tons of blog that are using fear to engage readers. I'm thinking about titles like:

* "Five useful CSS3 selectors you don't probably know"
* "Write bulletproof code with this three tips"
* "The 10 most common mistakes writing tests"
* "How I Made $10,000 From Google Last Month"

This kind of trick works the first time, but is very easy to get fed of it — try to suggest ideas in a cordial way, as a friend would do

### Keep it short and well structured

1) First say hello

2) One paragraph to introduce one advice

3) Second paragraph to present the second one

4) Say goodbye :-)
