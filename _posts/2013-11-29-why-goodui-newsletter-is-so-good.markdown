A couple of days ago I received my bi-weekly [GoodUI](http://www.goodui.org/) newsletter from [Jakub Linowski](https://twitter.com/jlinowski).

Writing emails is not an easy task, writing good emails is quite complex, and writing a newsletter is even harder — that's why I'm quite surprised to realise I haven't unsubscribed from it yet! :-)

And why are so good? Because Jakub applies lots of small and nice tricks — I tried to write them down and I got some great ideas I'd love to share.

But first let's show the email:

Why is this email working? Because...

<br>
### The email feels personal

Let's be clear: no ones likes automated emails. They are cold, impersonal and quite likely to end in the spam folder. So, what does the email do to fight against it?

He starts with a 'Hi Ignacio' — hey look, that's my name! — this is a very powerful trick.

**Dale Carnegie**, author of the best seller [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), wrote:

> If you want to win friends, make it a point to remember them. If you remember my name, you pay me a subtle compliment; you indicate that I have made an impression on you. Remember my name and you add to my feeling of importance.

**Second thing**: He sends the email from his personal email account. Is not a company, or a association. Is a real person, even Gmail shows his face (remember the [effect of human faces](http://blog.usabilla.com/effect-human-faces-web-design))

<p><img class="full-width-image" src="/images/goodui_sender.png" /></p>

Want to make it even more human? Jakub even finishes sharing some information about his personal life:

*"Hope this helps and sorry about skipping the email from two weeks ago - was on a nice little vacation in a warmer country (than snowy Canada). :)"*

When Jakub shares personal information two things happen:

1) Jakub feels more vulnerable, as he is revealing sensitive information other people can use, and

2) The reader feels more secure, safe and starts trusting more Jakub

Interesting, huh?

### It just suggest some ideas

Nowadays there are tons of blog that are using fear to engage readers. I'm thinking about titles like:

* "Seven useful CSS3 selectors you don't probably know"
* "Write bulletproof code with this three tips"
* "The 10 most common mistakes writing tests"
* "How I Made $10,000 From Google Last Month"

— Jesus! Seven CSS3 I don't know! let's click, because 1) I'm afraid there's something out there I don't know and 2) there's some risk I can avoid just clicking the link.

This kind of trick works the first time, but is very easy to get fed of it — GoodUI newsletter suggest ideas in a cordial way, as a friend would do, not using fear and anxiety.

<br>
### The email is short and well structured

And last, but not least, the email structure is as follows:

1) First say hello

2) One paragraph to introduce the first advice

3) Other paragraph to present the second one

4) Wrapping up and goodbye :-)

The better structured, the easier to read. Easy, isn't? 

Well, this are the main points I found. What you think about the email? Do you feel is effective? Can you find any other interesting element?

Cheers!
