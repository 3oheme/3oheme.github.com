Every journey comes to an end.

After more than five years working with [Spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/), now it's time to look for the next gig. 

I wanted to wait a bit to write about this, because I really needed to slow down and reflect about my time in the company, and I must say **working with Spotahome has been such an amazing journey** â€“ I'm so grateful to this huge opportunity to progress as a professional:
* Iâ€™ve helped the company grow from a headcount of 30 to more than 300 employees, from an angel round of â‚¬225K to a $40M Series-B round and from the most _move fast and break things_ to achieving the best quality in our processes.
* I've played tons of different roles: frontend developer, graphic designer, Head of User Experience, UI designer, project manager, agile and lean advocate, researcher, product designer...
* I've organised and facilitated more workshops than I can remember ðŸ˜…
* Designed hundreds of screens, features, UI components, flows, prototypes, copys, emails, landings...
* But the most important bit: **I've had the opportunity to work and build a friendship with a mind-blowing bunch of wonderful and talented people**. Every day I've been able to learn from them, laugh, have fun and build the best real estate marketplace, and that's something I will take with me forever.

I'm so lucky to have made some great friends in this adventure.

And what's next? Well, I will take some time off to enjoy the <a title="Link to a picture of my son in my instagram feed" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lIgljoDP7/">first steps of this little cutie</a>, try a couple of pet projects that I have in mind and think about what I'd like to do in the future. It's going to be fun, you bet it.

Thank you all, and see you soon.
