Every journey comes to an end.

After more than five years working with [Spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/), now it's time to look for the next gig.

It's been such an amazing journey â€“ I'm so grateful to this huge opportunity to progress as a professional:
* Iâ€™ve helped the company grow from a headcount of 30 to more than 300 employees, from an angel round of â‚¬225K to a $40M Series-B round.* I've played tons of different roles: frontend developer, graphic designer, Head of User Experience, UI designer, researcher, product designer...
* I've organised and facilitated more workshops than I can remember ðŸ˜…
* Designed hundreds of screens, features, UI components, flows and prototypes
* And the most important bit, I've had the opportunity to work and build a friendship with a mind-blowing bunch of wonderful and talented people. Everyday I've been able to learn from them, laugh, have fun and build the best real estate marketplace.

I'm so lucky to have made so amazing good friends in this adventure.

Now I will take some time off to enjoy the <a title="Link to a picture of my son in my instagram feed" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lIgljoDP7/">first steps of this little cutie</a>, try a couple of pet projects and think about what's next.

Cheers!
