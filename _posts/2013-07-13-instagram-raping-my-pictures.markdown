Before and hover for after. Or just click for full screen. Or just [see image as it appears in Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/boHqmuEMSn/).

Taken with a Nexus4, cropped and processed in Instagram and no other editing programs involved.

Am I the only one that is experiencing this kinds of problems? I know that Instagram is not Flickr or 500px, but this is way too far :-(
