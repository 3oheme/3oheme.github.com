We live in a male-centric society, where there's a massive oppresion against women — and, ironically, that also works as a boomerang effect against men.

Men are not supposed to cry, be sensitive, or complain of any pain. We must to be hard, and strong, and powerful.

Well, let me tell you that average life expectancy for men is almost 4 years less than women. Men have a 14% higher risk of developing cancer than women, and a 37% higher risk of dying from it. [As the movember.com website says](http://us.movember.com/mens-health/):

"The reason for the poor state of men’s health are numerous and complex and include:

* Lack of awareness and understanding of the health issues men face
* Men not openly discussing their health and how they’re feeling
* Reluctance to take action when men don’t feel physical or mentally well
* Men engaging in risky activities that threaten their health 
* Stigmas surrounding mental health"

That's why I like Movember, because it opens a door to talk about things that, oh, those strong men are afraid and scared to talk about.
That's why the moustache, dude. So start the conversation, the sooner the better.
