Yesterday Mircea and I were visiting Liverpool for our first [UXLiverpool meetup](http://bit.ly/1cv8LtD) and wow, it was very good, 17 people from different backgrounds learning and discussing about user experience and experience desig.

### How was it?

The main part of the meeting was covered by [Ian Walker](http://bit.ly/143iDBz) talk about [Key Project Processes for the whole team](http://bit.ly/1cv9pr2), where he presented a very nice overview of the complete UX process and he detailed **when** and **where** we should **involve other members of the team in the process**. 

As usual, the presentation lead to some very interesting debates and insights, and from my point of view, **this is one of the key aspects of this kind of meetings**: trying to extrapolate the information to your specific scenario, talking about your experiences applying different techniques, tips and tricks… 

Some interesting topics where:

* How can we build a meaningful single **persona** for a really big site like **amazon.com**?
* Tip: rather than spending time arguing about what specific implementation is better, is usually better to do **A/B testing** — and that can be real A/B or even just paper prototypes!
* If your app is an **Facebook app**, you can get really interesting feedback directly from the users — ask, start a conversation or just look what are writing :-)

### Anything else?

Yeah! the second interesting topic someone raised was about **'How to deal with designers'** in the way that sometimes, a process that starts with a low quality wireframe can suffer severe changes when applying the current visual guidelines.

**There are no magic bullets to solve this**, but only trying to **explain and involve more people in UX tasks**, so they can realise the whole user experience can be affected, and any visual element should help the final user.

### Should I go to the next one?

Sure! Please have a look at the [meetup UXLiverpool page](http://bit.ly/1cv8LtD), [follow them on twitter](https://twitter.com/uxliverpool) and join us next time :-)
