Is funny how human beings leave their marks and traces around the world — and even more funny in this digital world, you can grab and revive moments and feelings completely lossless from some time ago :-)

Recently I found an old iPod nano with music I used to listen (and compose) with some stuff like next song.

Is **just a 25 second intro**, where **the main line is made from very small chunks sampled from a Barry White theme** — probably [My First, My Last](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdTDFUaaL9s), but not sure — and the beat base is completely hand made (beats, breaks, compression and whatever).

The funny part is how just an small intro song can make you think about the big differences from the current Ignacio to the Ignacio 6 years ago.
