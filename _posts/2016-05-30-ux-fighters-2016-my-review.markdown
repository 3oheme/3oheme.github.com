I am a probably-too-much pragmatic person. That's why, every time I go to a conference, I cannot stop focusing on what can I learn and apply to my every day life. So, here's my review of the UX Fighters 2016. I prefer to give it a couple of weeks, so the distance helps having a more objective point of view, and skup all those logistic errors that really screwed me on the first day.

What I got from the UX Fighters 2016 is:

The **Kano model workshop** from [Juan José Elizondo](https://twitter.com/jj_elizondo) (latam) was simply terrific, and I learned a new technique for my user experience toolbelt. Learnings:

* Useful to priorize a project backlog using a user-centred approach.
* Focus on fixing dissatissfaction first
* Not a silver bullet (cultural differences, need a big user base to fetch a valid sample and stakeholders need to be taught).
* Learn to perform your UX lean and with a low budget, because this won't change even if you're working on a big company :-D

[Alberto Barreiro](https://twitter.com/albertobarreiro) and his **Digital killed the media star** gave me some really amazing quotes:

* "The one who controls the interface controls the business" about facebook being a proxy of all the big media companies.
* This one is amazing: "Mobile users trust the feed". As it's harder to type, they rely on Facebook giving them what they need.
* The feedback loop pushes us towards an opinion corner. Confirmation bias and "intelligent feeds" force users to enter in a feedback loop where everything they read support their opinions.

El supermercado del futuro: "If you come with data let's talk about the data. If you come with an opinion let's talk about mine."

**Direct Seguros case study** showed me [this beautifully designed measurement glass](http://www.madaboutthehouse.com/365-days-of-design-march-7-oxo-good-grips-angled-measuring-jug/) that you can see from above:

**Where are the limits of humor?** from Carlos Areces was just brilliant. Sadly I didn't take any notes.

"Make a briefing, even if you're your unique user" from the Comics and user experience talk.

Open data discussion: "You know that phrase of 'Data speaks for itself'? It's a lie" as not everyone is able to extract information from data.

The engaging and eye-opening **Discovery Program** talk from Pere Rosales taught me a word (that's also a new learning vector for me): [Basadur](http://www.basadur.com/).

Experiencias Efímeras from [Alejandro Herrera](https://twitter.com/alejndroherrera) showed me that maybe I was completely wrong about vertical video: If the video is going to be consumed in vertical format, it'd may be a good idea to record it vertically (and with things like periscope or facebook live, it's also easier to record it vertically)

This one sentence from [Juan Moyano](https://twitter.com/moyanoux) **We can be heroes** talk is simply gold: "The more people understanding a problem, the better. The less people implementing a solution, the better".

[Marcos Viñuela García](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-vi%C3%B1uela-garc%C3%ADa-718681b) taught me the startup triangle: [buscar triangulo] Personal Ego, self-realisation and ambition.

Fuerzas Vivas presentation from [Gonzalo Madrid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-madrid-g%C3%B3mez-285b3024) and [Toni Garrido](https://twitter.com/garridocoronado): "Common sense is disruptive" (as a force against company routine and doing the same things we've been doing because it's what we've been doing.)
