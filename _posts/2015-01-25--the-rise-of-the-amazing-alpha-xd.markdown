If you think an XD unicorn is cool, wait and see this one.

I’m a little information junkie, trying to be up-to-date about UX best practices — and recently I’ve been lucky enough to find out that a new kind of experience designer is just appearing right now, right in front of my eyes. One ahead of his time, that is revolutionizing the whole industry pain points by pivoting across transversal resources. 

**He is the ultimate designer, the [Alpha XD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29).**

This new kind has the incredible ability of knowing what to do in every and each situation. With no background, he already knows if you should use a Hamburger icon. With no context, he can tell you if your user journey is broken (and how to fix it!). With no delay, he can bear out you’re wrong.

Imagine the incredible endless possibilities! How awesome would it be! 

* No more user research — it doesn’t matter if the project is targeting elderly people with no technological background, or your users are under stress, he knows we should go fully flat design, period.
* Let’s get rid of that needless user testing! He has already done a redesign with hundreds of likes in dribbble and behance, so go and implement it, it will be a success!
* Resources? What resources? Your website menu is misaligned a couple of pixels, mostly because you fool are as careless as shit, so leave what you’re doing and fix it.
* And it doesn’t matter if you have a big user base that has been using it for years: your timeline presentation is wrong, you should fix it ASAP, and all your users will be as happy as a kid in a candy store.

Ok, enough sarcasm for today. I had to let off some steam.

So here it is: behind every design, app or website there’s a story. There is a cruel war, lots of stakeholders with different goals. There are tight deadlines, small budgets, slow servers. There’s a business model that probably you’re not aware of. Different designers, with limitations and constraints. 

But, most important, there is people. And they deserve a little respect.

So please, be kind before your next blog post. Thanks.
